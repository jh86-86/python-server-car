This is my first python server to do with cars

it will use postgres and flask 

it's current dependcies are:
flask = as a framework
psycopg2 = PostgreSQL database adapter
psycopg2--binary = apparanty sometimes this is needed in addition to psycopg2

flask-sqlalchemy = a library that facilitates the communication between Python programs and databases.
 Most of the times, this library is used as an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) tool that translates Python classes to 
tables on relational databases and automatically converts function calls to SQL statements.
